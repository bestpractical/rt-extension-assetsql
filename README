NAME
    RT-Extension-AssetSQL - SQL search builder for Assets

INSTALLATION
    RT-Extension-AssetSQL requires version RT 4.4.0 or later. Note that
    AssetSQL is incompatible with RT 4.2 running RT::Extension::Assets.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        This step may require root permissions.

    Patch your RT
        AssetSQL requires a small patch to work on versions of RT prior to
        4.4.2. To patch such older versions of RT, run:

            patch -d /opt/rt4 -p1 < patches/rt-4.4.0-4.4.1.patch

        RT versions 4.4.2 and later already contain the above patch.

        All versions of RT require the following patch for AssetSQL support:

            patch -d /opt/rt4 -p1 < patches/assetsql.patch

        You must apply both patches if you're on RT 4.4.0 or 4.4.1.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin( "RT::Extension::AssetSQL" );

        If you wish to hide the legacy Asset Simple Search, add the
        following line as well:

            Set($AssetSQL_HideSimpleSearch, 1);

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
